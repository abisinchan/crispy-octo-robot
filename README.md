Module 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description
I am sure there are many people like me that are forgetful. What better way is there to assist those in remembering things? Having a place to jot one thoughts is very handy. 
In this lesson I learned that order is important when writing Routes. I spent alot of time rewriting code, when finally it dawned on me to switch around the orders of routes.
