Module 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description
I am sure there are many people like me that are forgetful. What better way is there to assist those in remembering things? Having a place to jot one thoughts is very handy. 
In this lesson I learned that order is important when writing Routes. I spent alot of time rewriting code, when finally it dawned on me to switch around the orders of routes. 


## Installation

N/A. App deployed through Heroku.

## Usage
Upon landing on the landing page, press "Get Started". You will be taken to a notes page and may add a title and text. Once both have text a save icon will appear, and you would be able to save and see the note on the page. You can press on the title on the left side and see content on the right side. If for whatever reason you decide you want to delete a note, feel free to press trash icon, and your note will forever be deleted.
